    <h2>What is karak chai?</h2>
    <p>Karak chai or chai karak, or karak tea is a very commonly consumed tea in the Gulf region of the Middle East. It it similar to masala chai, but with less spices. </p>
    <p>You can make a chai karak with just tea, milk and sugar. Masala chai usually has peppercorns, cinnamon, whole spices, etc.</p>
    <h3>Karak tea ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong> can use white or brown. I used white sugar, which I caramelized in the pot before adding the rest of the ingredients. YUM!! You can totally skip the caramelizing step and just dissolve the sugar in the water.</li>
        <li><strong>Water: </strong> It’s easier to use hot water, so that the pot comes to a boil faster./li>
        <li><strong> Tea: </strong>Use black tea of your choice. It seems in the Gulf, everyone has a preference, whether it’s Lipton, or red label. I used loose leaves in this recipe, then strained them out. You can use tea bags instead, and I added that option to the recipe card.</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger: </strong> I added a few slices of fresh ginger, since I am definitely a ginger fan. Three slices was just enough, not overpowering in the least. You could use 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of ginger powder instead, or leave the ginger out completely if you aren’t a fan!</li>
        <li><strong>Spices: </strong>I kept it suuuper simple. Cardamom pods, since cardamom is usually the star of karak tea, a tiny pinch of saffron for the beautiful fragrance and flavor it gives, as well as whole cloves. You can add more or less of anything you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk: </strong>Traditionally, evaporated milk is used. It’s thick and creamy, but not sweet so you can instead control the sweetness with sugar. I added one small can and it was perfect, but add in more (or less !) if you like. You can even use cardamom flavored evaporated milk, widely available in the Middle East, and reduce the cardamom pods by half.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make karak tea:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>If caramelizing the sugar, add that first to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Allow the sugar to melt, undisturbed, until it turns into a liquid and then changes color to an amber caramel color.</li>
    <li>Once the sugar has caramelized into a liquid, slowly stream in the hot water. Stir to combine. If you don’t want to caramelize the sugar, you can add the sugar and hot water together to the saucepan, and stir until sugar dissolves.</li>
    <li>Add the tea, the ginger, and all the spices. Let this mixture come to a boil, and simmer for 5-7 minutes until fragrant.    </li>
</ol>
