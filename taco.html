    <h2>We just got tired of hamburger tacos and decided to try something authentic!</h2>
    <p>We love the lime infusion flavor in this recipe for shredded beef tacos with lime. Serve them with tortilla shells, lettuce, cheese, guacamole, and salsa. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
     <li>Whisk vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, and garlic together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add beef, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
     <li>Remove bag with beef from refrigerator; bring to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
     <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
     <li>Transfer beef and marinade to a large baking dish. Add beef stock; cover dish with aluminum foil.</li>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until beef is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Rest 10 minutes; shred with 2 forks. Drain and discard about 80% of liquid from beef; season with salt</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>Tip:</h3>
   <p>Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.</p>
